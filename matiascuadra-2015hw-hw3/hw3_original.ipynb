We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. In addition to what we do for the ROC curve, we now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve.

    "If you did the previous section right, you will find that the logistic regression model provides a better profit over some section of the profit curve than the baseline \"send to everyone\" classifier, while the SVM classifier is generally poor. At this might we might want to try all kinds of classifiers: from perceptrons to random forests. In the interest of time, and to study the SVM in some more detail, we'll restrict ourselves to trying to improve the SVM performance here. In real life you would try other classifiers as well.\n",

    " We wont be exhaustive in this improvement process either(which is something you should do on your project) in the interests of time, but we'll explore if feature-selection on the  SVM, and data balancing on the SVM (SVM's are known to perform better on balanced data) help.\n",

Also recall polynomial regression: a large number of features can lead to overfitting. Feature selection helps curb the problem of the curse of dimensionality, where centrality measures often used in statistics go wonky at higher dimensions. Between feature-engineering which we did some of, earlier, and feature selection, is where a lot of smarts and domain knowledge comes in. You will gain this with experience."

This can be implemented with `sklearn` pipelines.\n",

This is because you have leaked the response from the validation into your sub-training set, and cannot thus be confident about your predictions: you might overfit. In such a situation, you must do the feature selection inside the cross-validation fold. See http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/lec_10_cross_val.ipynb from the 2013 course for a particularly dastardly case of this, where you see that the problem is particularly exacerbated when you have many more features than samples.\n",

    "With a best model selected, let us run the classifier again for the given value of $C$ and the fit value of $\\gamma$ on the larger data set, and see our results. Output the classifier as `pipesvm3`. (Dont forget to run the entire pipeline again, even though there is no cross-validation. Also remember to pass the params directly to the classifier `SVC` as its arguments, setting the `parameters` argument of `do_classify` to `None`.) The code takes about 3-5 minutes on my computer."
